*RSA signature over an unknown elliptic curve.*

<!--more-->

### Description

*Our intern insisted on designing an elliptic-curve signature scheme. Needless to say, it wentâ€¦ quite wrong.He is now back at brewing coffee all day long.*

*nc 130.211.200.153 25519*

*[download](/resources/2016/tum/hiecss/vuln.py)*

### Details

Points:      150 Basepoints + 200 Bonuspoints * min(1, 3/27 Solves)

Category:    crypto

Validations: 27

### Solution
According to the script we have to input the server a message $$m$$ and a corresponding valid signature $$S$$. The signature has to be 64 byte long. The signature is verfified by computing $$h = \textrm{SHA}_{\textrm{256}}(m)$$. Then the point $$H$$ on the elliptic curve with axis coordinate $$h$$ is multiplied by $$e = 65537$$. If the resulting point has its $$x$$ coordinate matching $$S$$ then the signature is valid. 

The signature is verified over an elliptic curve howevever, the parameters of the curve are read from a file *curve.txt* which is not available to us. When I saw the connection parameters, I noticed that the port is **25519** so I thought that the server is using the parameters of the [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519) but I was wrong. Nevertheless, the first check of the script is to test is the signature is bigger than the prime $$q$$ which defines the underling finite field. Thus I could find $$q$$ with a simple binary search:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import socket
import binascii

tooBigMsg = b'\x1b[31mbad signature\x1b[0m\n'
upperNum = 0x24FB57DBA1EEA9BC3E660A909D838D726E3BF623D52620282013481D1F6E5377
lowerNum = 1

s = socket.socket()
host = "130.211.200.153"
port = 25519 
s.connect((host, port))

while upperNum - lowerNum > 3 :
    m = (upperNum + lowerNum) // 2
    s.send(binascii.hexlify(m.to_bytes(0x20, "big")) + b"\n")
    rsp = s.recv(1024)
    
    if rsp == tooBigMsg:
        upperNum = m+1
    else:
        lowerNum = m-1
    
print(m)
s.close()
```

which outputs $$q=16503925798136106726026894143294039201809205899921475051089186096065043153559$$ Then I could starts playing with the server. I sent the signature $$0$$ and it outputs:

```bash
$ nc 130.211.200.153 25519
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000Give me the flag. This is an order!
bad signature: (0x0, 0x18aae6ca595e2b030870f49d1aa143f4b46864eceab492f6f5a0f0efc9c90e51)
```

Meaning that $$P = (0, 11157465223991239684062113655986352032428557288843673787383336400593609100881)$$ is a valid point of the curve. Since the and elliptic curve follows the Weierstrass equation 

$$E:y^2=x3+ax+b$$

We have from the previous point $$b = \sqrt{y_P} = 8575167449093451733644615491327478728087226005203626331099704278682109092640$$

Then by trial and error I found another valid point $$Q = (454086624460063511464984254936031011189294057512315937409637584344757371137, \\ 11208099281518563318368897553609546096980221818831719178800111818393340854694)$$

Wich allows to recover the value of $$a$$:

$$a = \frac{y_Q^2 -  x_Q^3 - b}{x_Q} = 5079713781418039671549386476218981709382212150018593601284925328028384622133$$

At this point, the curve $$E$$ was completly defined. The valid signature is given by the point $$D = d \cdot H$$ such that 

$$ e \cdot d \cdot H = H$$

And thus $$d = e^{-1} \mod \#E$$ where $$\#E$$ is the order of the curve $$E$$. Sage revealed easly the order of the curve:

```python
a = 0xb3b04200486514cb8fdcf3037397558a8717c85acf19bac71ce72698a23f635
b = 0x12f55f6e7419e26d728c429a2b206a2645a7a56a31dbd5bfb66864425c8a2320
p = 0x247ce416cf31bae96a1c548ef57b012a645b8bff68d3979e26aa54fc49a2c297
e = 65537

F = FiniteField(p)
E =  EllipticCurve(F, [ a, b ])
order =E.order()
d = e.inverse_mod(order)

print(order)
print(d)


16503925798136106726026894143294039201930439456987742756395524593191976084900
13325880669850135947955584744200843377764515689540570722495414420830062384373
```

Thus we can create the hash point $$H$$ compute a valid signature point $$D = d \cdot H$$. However, our signature was always refused by the server. Looking closer to the code we noticed that:

$$h = 10826343561888283586707329693140326181071376199543143027569123040469103293774$$

which is greater than $$q$$ so it will be reduced modulo $$q$$ and the hash will never match. Nevertheless, the ending spaces are remove from the message before the comparison. So I tried to add ending spaces to the message until the hash is less than $$q$$ and finally I got the solution:

```bash
$./solution.py
