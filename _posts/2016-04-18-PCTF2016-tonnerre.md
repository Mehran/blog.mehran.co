*Public-key based authentication protocol for which we had to write a
client, after finding credentials through SQL injection.*

<!--more-->

### Description


*We were pretty sure the service at tonnerre.pwning.xxx:8561
([source](/resources/2016/pctf/tonnerre/server.py)) was totally secure.
But then we came across [this website](http://tonnerre.pwning.xxx:8560/)
and now weâ€™re having second thoughts... We think they store the service
users in the same database?*

### Details

Points:      200

Validations: 119


### Solution

The web login form waas vulnerable to basic SQL injection. Running
`sqlmap` directly gave the content of the table `users` in the database
`tonnerre`: a single user `get_flag` and two values: 

* `salt`, a random-looking 127-byte string
* `verifier`, a random-looking 145-byte string

These values were to be used in a public key-based authentication
protocol, remotely similar to SRP, whose server side was implemented in
the Python program given to us. Copying only the interesting part, with
my comments:

```python
N = ... # a 1024-bit prime number, the group modulus

g = ... # a 671-bit number, a group generator

...

   # generates a key pair
    random_server = random.randint(2, N-3)
    public_server = pow(g, random_server, N)

    # mask the public key with the verifier
    residue = (public_server + permitted_users[username][1]) % N

    # send salt and masked pubkey
    req.sendall(tostr(permitted_users[username][0]) + '\n')
    req.sendall(tostr(residue) + '\n')

    # compute the session key,
    #   masking the client pubkey with the verifier
    #   raising to the server's secret exponent
    #   hashign the whole thing using SHA-256
    session_secret = (public_client * permitted_users[username][1]) % N
    session_secret = pow(session_secret, random_server, N)
    session_key = H(tostr(session_secret))

    # receive a proof from the client..
    proof = req.recv(512).strip('\n')

    # ..should be a hash of the server's masked pubkey and session key
    if (proof != H(tostr(residue) + session_key)):
      req.sendall('Sorry, not permitted.\n')
      req.close()
      return

    # this is useless for the challenge
    our_verifier = H(tostr(public_client) + session_key)
    req.sendall(our_verifier + '\n')

    # send us the flag!
    req.sendall('Congratulations! The flag is ' + flag + '\n')
    req.close()
```

Let's call `(s, S)` the server's key pair and `(c, C)` the client's key pair, such that `g^s=S` and `g^c=C`.

So it looks like the client receives the server's Diffie-Hellman public
key (after unmasking using the verifier), but then the shared key will
be
```
(C * verifier)^s = g^(cs) * verifier^s
```
And since the client doesn't know the server's private exponent `s`
we can't determine the shared key. What's the catch?

The trick was that `public_client` shouldn't be the client's public key
`C`, but `C` multiplied by the *inverse of `verifier`*. Using the
standard modular inversion algorithm, we can computer the verifier's
inverse modulo the prime `N`.

We could then authenticate with the following program (again, showing
only the non-trivial part):

```python
random_client = random.randint(2, N-2)
public_client = pow(g, random_client, N)

invver = modinv(verifier, N)

public_client2 = invver * public_client % N

if ((public_client2 * verifier) % N) == public_client:
    print 'verifier verified'

s.sendall(tostr(public_client2) + '\n')

# get salt and server pubkey
salt = int(s.recv(512).strip('\n'), 16) % N
residue = int(s.recv(512).strip('\n'), 16) % N
public_server = (residue - verifier + N) % N

session_secret = pow(public_server, random_client, N)
session_key = H(tostr(session_secret))

proof = H(tostr(residue) + session_key)

s.sendall(proof + '\n')
time.sleep(0.5)
r = s.recv(512).strip('\n')
print r
```

Then:

```
python tonnerre_solve.py
Welcome to the Tonnerre Authentication System!
