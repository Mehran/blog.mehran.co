*To authenticate on a server we had to provide a message signed with a RSA private key. Hopefully the server allows us to sign any message execpt the one requested with the same key.*

### Description

*We have set up this fancy automatic signing server!*

*We also uses RSA authentication, so itâ€™s super secure!*

*nc 104.196.116.248 54321*

### Solution

When we connected to the server, it allow us to sign any message. To check which kind of encryption is is we sent 1 and the answer was 1. We could deduce that plain RSA without padding was used *i.e*:

``` python
c = pow(m,d,n)
```

However, here n is unknown. We can make a guess that e=65535 and since m**d**e == m mod n we can recover n with:

``` python
import gmpy2

p1 = 2
c1 = ...
p2 = 3
c2 = ...
n = gmpy2.gcd(c1**e -p1, c2**e-p2)
n
```

After a few minutes of computation we got:
``` python
n = ...
```

the message to sign was m="". The idea to bypass the server is to sign m*2 and the inverse of 2 modulo n and finally the correct signature is m*2/2.
