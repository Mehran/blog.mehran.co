Repo for duksctf.github.io blog.

# Guideline to post a new Writeup:

1. clone the actual repo with "git clone git@github.com:duksctf/duksctf.github.io.git"
2. in the _posts directory copy the template available under _drafts/xxxx-xx-xx-CTFYEAR-name-of-the-task.md.
3. Edit the template at your convenience, don't change the layout and the
   title, rename it with 2016-MM-DD-CTFYEAR-name-of-the-task.md 
4. When you think everything is ready, git add _posts/yournewwriteup.md
5. git commit -m 'added writeup for CTF XXX task XXX'
6. git push
